enumerate
=========

A Python script which batch renames files in ascending numeric order. Accepts single or multiple filenames as well as wildcards. If an output filename is given, it's used as a prefix for the resulting files. If a number of digits is given, it will print any number with fewer digits than that with leading zeroes.

For help, use:
$ enumerate --help
